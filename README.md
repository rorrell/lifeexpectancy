# lifeexpectancy
A Jupyter Notebook where I create a chart with two line plots on it to check out the life expectancy of men vs. women from 1900-2018 and draw some conclusions from that.

The data is from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth/resource/eb20e7ad-2a82-4dce-82df-503a0bdb27be
